# 2019-10-28: Bern

I'm checking in with a post-workshop report on lessons learned from hosting my first solo astropy workshop at (my new home institution) the University of Bern, Switzerland. Workshop materials are [here](https://github.com/bmorris3/astropy-workshop-bern-2019) for posterity.

Responses from the intake survey are attached and are available as a spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GZBqBV3ozM0q3XNPIeuj0cp6eiiMoapxPOAORQRgdrM/edit?usp=sharing), which I created specifically for this workshop. Main takeaways: 
* 100% of attendees said this was their first astropy workshop
* 90% of attendees said they use Python in their research, but to my surprise...
* 40% of attendees said they've never used astropy before

I think this result is neat, it shows how much we have to gain by going around and giving these workshops. There are still plenty of untapped users out there!

I tailored the curriculum to people’s requests on the intake survey to minimize the sense of overwhelm felt at the 2019 AAS workshop. The attendees voted to get [extra lessons](https://github.com/bmorris3/astropy-workshop-bern-2019/tree/master/11-Extras) from my home-spun curriculum on object-oriented programming, HDF5 in Python, and releasing your own python package using the astropy package-template. The package-template demo got some audible gasps.

Responses from the outgoing survey are attached and are available as a spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gbj5w1Dh22WWPln_-NT4Z_EX-zDvsL1A2KdmmIYHKmg/edit?usp=sharing). It looks a lot like the outgoing survey in the 2019 AAS astropy workshop. Main takeaways: 
* The section people perceived as least clear was the section on astropy.coordinates. I think this is an artifact of the ~70% of attendees who consider themselves theorists, who said they don’t work with coordinates regularly.

The schedule of the workshop looked like [this](https://github.com/bmorris3/astropy-workshop-bern-2019#schedule), and the timing was mostly on target. The one section that took significantly longer than the allotted time was the Intro to Python, which took an extra 20 minutes. If I recall correctly, the same was true at the 2019 AAS workshop – I think we might need to allocate more time (one full hour?) for that section. I also cut the coffee breaks down from 30 minutes to 15 minutes, because the 30 minute breaks became “Q&A with Brett over coffee” sessions, so I cut each one a bit short so we could do the same Q&A at our laptops. 

We should probably write up docs to standardize this workshop-hosting process for future trainers. Here are some tips that helped make this workshop run smoothly: 

* Allocate at least a full workday (eight hours) to prep for the workshop – testing the full workshop takes longer than you’d think
* Have a dedicated “setup hour” before the workshop where people can come in and debug their installations before the workshop begins – we had an extra help session at 9am and had zero (!) users with installation bugs when we began the tutorials at 10 am
* Arrange for extra power chords to be available in the room – you can never have too many for a day-long workshop
* Be sure to have green+red stickies for help flags – people are more likely to ask for help when they have a protocol
* Provide coffee and snacks – people come back from breaks recharged and ready to go
* Always make the text larger on your screen – accessibility matters
* Have experienced helpers who float around during the exercises – helpers fix problems as they happen, minimizing user downtime
* Send emails about the workshop one month before, one week before, and the day of the workshop – advertising works

If you like, I can make a PR to the astropy-workshop repo (or somewhere else?) with a checklist with these items.

Thanks again to Kelle for the astropy stickers, they were a big hit! Based on my careful observations, 25% of attendees stuck their stickers on their laptops by the end of the workshop.
